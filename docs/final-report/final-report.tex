While Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has been widely studied for high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, the efficacy and limitations of OCR models on Southeast Asian (SEA) languages remain largely unexplored. This study aims to bridge this gap by evaluating OCR technologies for SEA languages and exploring script-specific challenges. We propose a pipeline to collect textual data from Wikipedia and benchmark open-source OCR tools. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of fine-tuning existing models on SEA languages, aiming to expand OCR capabilities for these languages.

\chapter{Introduction}
Current research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is heavily concentrated on only 20 of the 7,000 languages in the world \parencite{magueresse-etal-2020}.
In particular, Southeast Asia (SEA) is home to over 1,000 languages but remains a relatively under-researched region in NLP \parencite{aji-etal-2023}.
A similar trend can be observed in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) research, where the focus is predominantly on high-resource languages \parencite{salehudin-etal-2023, smith-2007}, leaving many SEA languages underserved.

OCR, the process of converting textual images into machine-readable formats, offers significant potential for languages with limited datasets. While many scanned documents and books in these low-resource languages are available online, the text within them often remains inaccessible due to formats like images and PDFs. By extracting the text from these documents, OCR can generate valuable datasets for low-resource languages, which can then be used for downstream NLP tasks, such as machine translation and named-entity recognition \parencite{agarwal-and-anastasopoulos-2024, ignat-etal-2022}.
Therefore, studying OCR performance on SEA languages is crucial to accelerating NLP research and technology development in the region.

While OCR has been widely studied for high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, the efficacy and limitations of OCR models on SEA languages remain largely unexplored.
To address this gap, this study presents a pipeline to collect textual data from Wikipedia and benchmark several open-source OCR tools on the collected data. Additionally, we explore the potential of fine-tuning existing models to improve OCR performance on SEA languages. The primary objective is to evaluate and enhance the performance of OCR technologies on SEA languages, thereby advancing NLP applications in this linguistically diverse region.

Specifically, this project seeks to answer the following research questions (RQs):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} How do popular OCR tools perform on SEA scripts?
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} What script-related challenges affect OCR accuracy on SEA languages?
    \item \textbf{RQ3:} What techniques and recommendations can enhance OCR accuracy on SEA languages?
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Related Work}

\section{Overview of OCR Systems}

To benchmark OCR performance programmatically, there are two broad categories of OCR systems: open-source and commercial.

Open-source OCR systems are characterized by their accessibility, allowing users to view, modify, and distribute the source code freely.
This transparency enables developers to customize the tools to meet specific needs.
Furthermore, open-source systems typically incur no licensing fees, making them cost-effective options for research purposes.
For instance, Tesseract \parencite{smith-2013} is a popular open-source OCR engine mentioned consistently in related studies \parencite{hegghammer-2022, ignat-etal-2022}.

Commercial OCR systems are typically accessed through paid services via application programming interfaces (APIs).
Notable examples of these systems include Amazon Textract, Google Document AI, and Google Vision API.
Generally, commercial off-the-shelf OCR tools tend to perform better than their open-source counterparts \parencite{hegghammer-2022, ignat-etal-2022}.
However, the proprietary nature of these "black box" models limits their utility for research purposes, such as fine-tuning and customization.
Additionally, the associated costs of these services contribute to fewer studies focused on commercial systems in comparison to the more widely researched open-source tools.

\section{OCR on Low-resource Languages}

Applying OCR yields a plain text prediction, which is then compared with the ground truth data to assess the toolâ€™s accuracy and performance.
Recent studies have demonstrated that OCR systems tend to perform better on artificially generated data than on real-world data \parencite{ignat-etal-2022}.
This observation suggests that synthetic datasets may not fully capture the complexities of authentic documents, which often feature issues like imperfect text alignment, varied fonts, and complex layouts.
Furthermore, the addition of synthetic noise significantly raises error rates, especially for open-source systems, which appear more susceptible to noise interference than their commercial counterparts \parencite{hegghammer-2022}.

When comparing performance on different scripts, OCR tools generally achieve higher accuracy on scripts written in Latin alphabets \parencite{hegghammer-2022, ignat-etal-2022}.
This disparity in performance partly stems from market incentives that prioritize the development of English-language OCR systems, resulting in more extensive training data and refinement for Latin-based scripts. 
Ornate scripts, such as those with complex diacritics or unique letter shapes, present additional challenges and tend to yield lower OCR accuracy.

In terms of benchmarking OCR on SEA languages, the most related study is the recent work by \textcite{ignat-etal-2022}.
They grouped 60 low-resource languages by region and script, including SEA languages like Khmer, Lao, Burmese, Thai, and Vietnamese.
Their research revealed that while OCR models perform well on artificial SEA-language data, accuracy drops significantly on real-world data.
This discrepancy underscores the need for more real-world training data to improve OCR outcomes for SEA languages.

In summary, there exists a gap in benchmarking OCR specifically for SEA languages, largely due to the lack of real-world training data.
This project addresses this gap by proposing a reusable pipeline for benchmarking OCR performance on real-world SEA-language data sourced from Wikipedia.

\section{Using Synthetic Data for OCR Evaluation}

To evaluate OCR performance accurately, a collection of textual data in the form of images or PDFs paired with reliable ground truth is needed.
Similar to most NLP tasks, data scarcity poses a major obstacle to advancing OCR technology in low-resource languages, where the limited availability of annotated textual data restricts both model training and evaluation.
Although an abundance of scanned documents in these low-resource languages exists online, they lack the ground truth required for evaluation.
While plain text in these languages is often available separately, it typically exists in text-based formats rather than images or PDFs, limiting its direct usefulness as ground truth for OCR.

To bridge this gap, many studies rely on artificial images and PDFs generated from plain text to create usable evaluation data.
For instance, \textcite{ignat-etal-2022} artificially created PDFs from the Flores 101 dataset, which consists of text data from Wikipedia in 101 languages.
Generalizing this concept of a document creation pipeline further, \textcite{gupte-etal-2021} published an open-source Python package for generating document images from plain text, including several document styling templates.
Using these methods, high-quality low-resource language data paired with ground truth can be generated from text-based formats on a large scale.

A common trend in using artificial data is the augmentation of noise to simulate real-world conditions, which often contain complex layouts, stains, and scribbles \parencite{hegghammer-2022}.
Directly using noise-free data, i.e., single-column text in a clear font, limits OCR processors' usefulness on real-life scanned documents.
Thus, noise augmentation is often applied to artificial data.
Some popular techniques include changing font style, size, color, letter spacing, and adding Gaussian blur, bleed-through, and salt-and-pepper noise \parencite{gupte-etal-2021, ignat-etal-2022}.

\section{Fine-tuning OCR Systems}

\chapter{Methodology}

To answer the research questions, this study conducts three experiments to benchmark and improve OCR performance on SEA languages.

\section{Experiment Setup}

\subsection{Languages}

In this study, we chose to benchmark on English, Indonesian, Vietnamese, and Thai. English serves as a baseline comparison due to its extensive OCR research and established tool support. Meanwhile, Indonesian, Vietnamese, and Thai were selected as a representative subset of SEA languages for several reasons.

Firstly, these three languages encompass a range of script types: Latin scripts for Indonesian, Latin scripts with diacritics for Vietnamese, and Brahmic scripts for Thai. 
By covering these scripts, we capture a broad spectrum of orthographic features, from diacritics to tone marks and from Latin-based scripts to complex character shapes. This allows us to examine how these unique linguistic features impact OCR performance. 
Furthermore, many other SEA languages, including Malay, Filipino, and Cebuano, use modified Latin scripts, while languages like Khmer, Burmese, and Javanese use Brahmic scripts. Thus, findings from this study can be applied to other languages with similar script types, accelerating OCR research in the region.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Benchmarked Languages}
    \label{table:languages}
    \begin{tabular}{llll}
        \toprule
        & Speaker Population & Script Type & Example\\ 
        \midrule
        English & 1.5 billion & Latin & Good morning\\
        Indonesian & 252 million & Latin & Selamat pagi\\
        Vietnamese & 97 million & Latin with diacritics & ChÃ o buá»•i sÃ¡ng\\
        Thai & 71 million & Brahmic & {\fontspec{Tahoma} à¸ªà¸§à¸±à¸ªà¸”à¸µà¸•à¸­à¸™à¹€à¸Šà¹‰à¸²}\\
        \bottomrule
        \multicolumn{4}{c}{\footnotesize Note: Speaker population data from Wikipedia (\citeyear{list-of-languages-by-total-number-of-speakers-2025}).}
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Secondly, the wide usage of these languages makes it feasible to obtain textual data. The high number of speakers, active online communities, and abundant digital content ensure sufficient resources for OCR benchmarking. Their prominence in SEA further highlights their relevance, as improving OCR for these languages benefits a large portion of the region's population.

While this study covers only a small fraction of the languages spoken in SEA, the selection of these languages provides a strong starting point, as they cover popular script types and offer abundant online data for benchmarking.

\subsection{Data Source}

To collect textual data, this study uses Wikipedia due to its accessibility and multilingual scope.
Wikipedia articles can be converted into images via screenshots, simulating real-world OCR scenarios. 
The platform also offers a convenient Application Programming Interface (API) that allows retrieval of plain text from most articles, serving as a reliable reference for evaluating OCR accuracy and generating synthetic documents.
Moreover, the availability of large corpora in various SEA languages, including Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Tamil, and Burmese, makes Wikipedia suitable for this study's language needs \parencite{list-of-wikipedias-2024}. 

\subsection{OCR Systems}

In our selection of OCR systems for benchmarking, we prioritize open-source 
solutions that support a diverse range of SEA languages, promoting accessibility and reusability for the proposed evaluation pipeline. 
Additionally, we aim to include models with different underlying architectures, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of their performance across different languages.
Consequently, we selected EasyOCR, Tesseract, and GOT, each representing distinct modeling approaches to OCR.

EasyOCR\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR}} is a modern OCR framework that integrates a text detection model 
based on the Character Region Awareness for Text (CRAFT) algorithm with a 
recognition model utilizing a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN).

Tesseract\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract}} is an established OCR engine, recognized as one of the top performers in the 1995 UNLV Test \parencite{rice-etal-1995}. It utilizes an underlying Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. 

Both EasyOCR and Tesseract provide robust support for English, Indonesian, Vietnamese, and Thai, making them suitable candidates for our benchmarking study.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

\begin{equation}
    CER = \frac{I + D + S}{N}
    \label{equation:cer}
\end{equation}

Similar to most OCR benchmark studies, we utilize Character Error Rate (CER) and 
Word Error Rate (WER) as our evaluation metrics \parencite{hegghammer-2022, ignat-etal-2022}. 
CER measures the accuracy of character recognition and is calculated using the Levenshtein or edit distance, which represents the minimum number of single-character insertions (I), deletions (D), 
and substitutions (S) required to transform one word into another. 
As shown in Equation \ref{equation:cer}, CER is defined as the edit distance between the OCR-predicted text and ground truth text, divided by the total number of characters in the ground truth text (N). 
A lower CER value indicates higher accuracy, with 0 representing perfect recognition. Notably, CER can exceed 1 when there is a significant number of insertions. WER serves as the word-based counterpart to CER.

\subsection{Data Collection}

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/data-collection.png}
    \caption{Pipeline for data collection from Wikipedia}
    \label{figure:data-collection}
\end{figure}

From the dataset of 100 Wikipedia articles, we collected article images and ground 
truth article text in our selected languages using Python, 
Selenium\footnote{\href{https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io}{Selenium} is a 
framework for automating web browsers, commonly used for web scraping by programmatically 
interacting with websites.}, and the MediaWiki Action API\footnote{The \href{https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page}{MediaWiki Action API} allows 
access to wiki page operation features such as search and retrieval.}. Figure \ref{figure:data-collection} illustrates the overall pipeline 
for data collection. The detailed steps are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Manually compile the datasetâ€™s article names and URLs in English.
    \item Fetch the article names and URLs in Thai, Vietnamese, and Indonesian from the MediaWiki Action API.
    \item Download the article PDFs in all languages using Selenium.
    \item Convert the article PDFs into PNG images, where each image represents one page in the PDF.
    \item Download the ground truth article text into TXT files from the MediaWiki Action API.
\end{enumerate}
